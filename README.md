# Phantom-Hunters
Unity | 2D Platformer | Solo Project

Phantom Hunters is a 2D side-scrolling platformer built in Unity. Designed as a solo project during university, it blends action, exploration, and light horror elements in a haunted, fog-drenched world filled with traps and hostile phantoms.

This prototype focuses on responsive controls, enemy interactions, and atmosphere-driven level design.

Features
- 2D side-scrolling movement with jump and combat mechanics
- Enemy AI: patrolling and chasing phantoms
- Health and damage system
- Atmospheric visual effects (fog, lighting, background parallax)
- Sound effects and ambient audio to build tension
- Short, handcrafted level with traps and enemy encounters

## Tech Stack
- Unity (2D URP)
- C# scripting
- Sprite-based animation and lighting
- Built for Windows

## Project Status
The project is feature-complete as a prototype. While not intended as a full game, it showcases my solo work in 2D movement, game flow design, and environmental storytelling.

## Developer Notes
This game was inspired by classic platformers with a spooky twist. I handled all code, level design, and implementation. Most art and audio were sourced from royalty-free or CC-licensed assets.

Design, programming, and level layout by me.
